abstract = {Incorporation of photochromic compounds to polymer matrix through chemical bonding results in an enhancement of photoactivity and stabilization of optical properties. Here, spiropyran ethyl acrylate monomer (SPEA) was synthesized, and then photochromic particles bearing epoxy functional groups were prepared through semicontinuous emulsion copolymerization. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results depicted an increase in particle size and particle size distribution with the increase in SPEA monomer-surfactants ratio. Studies on photochromic properties by UV-vis analysis demonstrated a decrease in the absorption intensity despite the increase in SPEA content due to the enhancement in particle size. The prepared acrylic copolymer particles showed reasonable photostability, photoreversibility, and fast photoresponsivness according to the convenient test methods under UV/vis irradiation. DSC and DMTA analyses indicate an increase in T<inf>g</inf> of the obtained copolymers with the increase in SPEA content. Finally, stimuli-responsive cellulosic papers were prepared by impregnation, and their photochromic behavior was investigated in dry and wet forms in various media under UV radiation. Morphology studies, due to stabilization of the photochromic copolymer on cellulose fibers, were conducted by SEM micrographs and showed good adhesion and compatibility between the two phases.},

abstract = {Electrospinning of nanofibers has developed quickly from a laboratory curiosity to a highly versatile method for the preparation of a wide variety of nanofibers, which are of interest from a fundamental as well as a technical point of view. A wide variety of materials has been processed into individual nanofibers or nanofiber mats with very different morphologies. The diverse properties of these nanofibers, based on different physical, chemical, or biological behavior, mean they are of interest for different applications ranging from filtration, antibacterial coatings, drug release formulations, tissue engineering, living membranes, sensors, and so on. A particular advantage of electrospinning is that numerous non-fiber forming materials can be immobilized by electrospinning in nanofiber nonwovens, even very sensitive biological objects such as virus, bacteria, and cells. The progress made during the last few years in the field of electrospinning is fascinating and is highlighted in this Feature Article, with particular emphasis on results obtained in the authors' research units.

In particular, such an approach is used to investigate the design optimization of planar stent cell.The results of the strut profile optimization confirm the key role of a tapered strut design to enhance the stent fatigue strength, suggesting that it is possible to achieve a marked improvement of both the fatigue safety factor and the scaffolding capability simultaneously.

abstract = {Concrete is a material that is widely used in the construction market due to its availability and cost, although it is prone to fracture formation. Therefore, there has been a surge in interest in self-healing materials, particularly self-healing capabilities in green and sustainable concrete materials, with a focus on different techniques offered by dozens of researchers worldwide in the last two decades. However, it is difficult to choose the most effective approach because each research institute employs its own test techniques to assess healing efficiency. Self-healing concrete (SHC) has the capacity to heal and lowers the requirement to locate and repair internal damage (e.g., cracks) without the need for external intervention. This limits reinforcement corrosion and concrete deterioration, as well as lowering costs and increasing durability. Given the merits of SHCs, this article presents a thorough review on the subject, considering the strategies, influential factors, mechanisms, and efficiency of self-healing. This literature review also provides critical synopses on the properties, performance, and evaluation of the self-healing efficiency of SHC composites. In addition, we review trends of development in research toward a broad understanding of the potential application of SHC as a superior concrete candidate and a turning point for developing sustainable and durable concrete composites for modern construction today. Further, it can be imagined that SHC will enable builders to construct buildings without fear of damage or extensive maintenance. Based on this comprehensive review, it is evident that SHC is a truly interdisciplinary hotspot research topic integrating chemistry, microbiology, civil engineering, material science, etc. Furthermore, limitations and future prospects of SHC, as well as the hotspot research topics for future investigations, are also successfully highlighted.},

In recent times, extensive research has been performed to address the challenges allied with long-term durability, reliability, serviceability, properties and sustainable production (via adopting a circular economy in biocomposites). This article presents a critical review of the recent works allied with different aspects of biocomposites. We initially review the overall characteristic including, the extraction, chemical composition, and physical and mechanical properties of the most popular biopolymers and biofibers (based on natural and synthetic resources) employed for fabricating biocomposites. The approaches and advances in enhancing the properties of biocomposites are also reviewed, including fiber treatment and modification, fiber hybridization, incorporation of fillers, advanced manufacturing techniques, and exploration of new biofiber and polymer resources. Also, the present techniques and the developments employed for the manufacturing of biocomposites are discussed, with an emphasis on additive manufacturing techniques (AM) in order to meet the aspirations of lightweight composites. The opportunities and challenges allied with fused filament fabrication (FFF) AM of biocomposite are also discussed in detail. Finally, the characterization techniques, environmental effects, major applications, and trends and challenges of biocomposites are briefly discussed.

The research here presented focused on the addition of granular paraffin PCM into a cement-based mortar to improve its thermal storage capacity, and of hydrophobic graphene to counterbalance the reduction in thermal conductivity. Experimental tests at laboratory scale and numerical simulations were carried out to compare the behavior of two equivalent radiant floor samples in terms of temperatures and heat fluxes. Lower temperature fluctuations and delayed minimum temperatures were observed in the mortar with PCM and graphene, if compared to the Reference one. Eventually, in order to investigate the possibility of using the new mortar in case of building refurbishment, a floor with the enhanced mortar lowered 1 cm was simulated and then compared to the reference one. Results showed that the surface of the lowered floor reached the same maximum temperature with the system on and up to 3 K higher with the system off.},

This research examines 3D-printed polylactic acid structures incorporated with microencapsulated PCM, targeting a more efficient thermoregulation in foundational architectural sections such as walls, floors, and ceilings. Through rigorous evaluations, the polylactic acid-PCM composite revealed promising thermoregulatory properties. Notably, latent heat values stood at 198.4 J/g for melting and 197.9 J/g for freezing. Real-world experiments demonstrated a distinct advantage, maintaining temperatures 3.2°C–3.3 °C higher than standard polylactic acid at night and exhibiting a cooler range of 10.4 °C–13.3 °C during daylight. Within specific geographical contexts, like the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas coastline, 0.026 m thick polylactic acid-PCM panels stood out, registering 100 % energy savings. The findings consistently showed that an increase in panel thickness correlated with a decrease in building heating needs. Further analysis explored the carbon emissions landscape. Coal, when utilized with 0.05 m-thick polylactic acid-PCM panels, was identified as particularly effective, yielding a reduction of 34 kg/m2 in annual CO2 emissions. Collectively, the findings underscore the transformative potential of polylactic acid-PCM composites, positioning them as pivotal tools for advancing architectural energy efficiency and fostering sustainable building innovations.},

Challenges to synthesizing and characterizing the SMA-reinforced SHMMCs and the strategies followed to overcome those challenges are discussed. To design the SMA-reinforced SHMMCs, it is necessary to understand their microstructural evolution during melting and solidification. This requires the knowledge of the thermodynamics of phase diagrams and nonequilibrium solidification, which are presented in this paper for a model self-healing composite system. Healing assessment provides information about the autonomous and multicycle healing capability of synthesized SHMMCs, which ultimately determines their success. Different techniques to assess the degree of healing of SHMMCs are discussed in this paper. Strategies are explored to find the optimum volume fraction of SMA wires needed to yield the matrix and prevent damage to the SMA wires for the most effective healing. Finally, major challenges, knowledge gaps, and future research directions, including the need for autonomous and multicycle healing capability in SMA-reinforced SHMMCs, are outlined.},

abstract = {Nowadays, thanks to the growing interest regarding the manufacturing of 3D complex parts with integrated functionalities, the additive manufacturing of NiTi shape memory alloy is a challenging technological issue. Particularly, 3D printing of NiTi components requires a strong interaction between technological and metallurgical approaches, due to the significant correlation among the process conditions, the microstructure, and the functional performances. The goals of the present work are to define the processability of NiTi powder for realizing fully dense samples using Selective Laser Melting process and the correlation between the microstructure and the superelastic response of specimens processed in different process conditions. It was found that highest relative density values can be obtained for a laser fluence in the range 63–160 J/mm3. The resulting microstructures exhibit variable degrees of orientations, according to the different cooling rates and melt pool size, specific for each condition. Finally, mechanical testing in compression indicated that the as-built alloy exhibits a limited superelastic behavior. A typical flag-like behavior, characterized by 6% of complete recoverable strain, was obtained through heat treatment at 500 °C. This suggests that the microstructure of as-built samples is highly efficient to promote superelasticity after annealing.},

abstract = {Lack of clean water is a major global challenge. Membrane separation technology is an ideal choice for the treatment of industrial, domestic sewage owing to its low energy consumption and cost. However, membranes are highly susceptible to contamination, particularly during wastewater treatment, which has limited their practical applications in this field. Similarly, the flux of the membrane decreases with prolonged use due to its reduced interlayer spacing. Preparation of membranes with anticontamination properties and stable flux is the key to addressing this problem. In this study, a 2D heterostructure membrane with visible-light-driven self-cleaning performance is prepared via a self-assembly process. Notably, the addition of palygorskite increases the interlayer spacing of the graphene and heterojunction structures, which increases the flux of the membrane and avoids a decrease of the interlayer spacing of the membrane under pressure. The presence of a heterojunction with visible light catalytic properties effectively avoids membrane fouling and avoids a sharp decrease of the permeation flux. Importantly, the prepared 2D membrane has excellent separation performance for oil–water emulsions with both high flux and efficiency. These features suggest great potential for the prepared 2D membrane in wastewater treatment applications.},

abstract = {The repair of diabetic bone defects is still challenging as the innate healing process is impaired by adverse microenvironments such as excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insufficient angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Herein, a self-adaptive biocomposite scaffold that can orchestrate sequential regulation of diabetic microenvironment and vascularized bone regeneration was developed for efficient diabetic bone defect repair. The therapeutic scaffold system was meticulously constructed through the incorporation of hydrogel and 3D-printed architecture. In response to the multiple diabetic microenvironment (high level of glucose and ROS), the hydrogel consisting of Vitamin C-loaded phenylboric acid-grafted poly (glutamic acid)/poly (vinyl alcohol) showed adaptive degradation and antioxidative properties by scavenging the intracellular ROS, as well as promoting M2 polarization of macrophages. Furthermore, the copper-doped bioactive glass-contained 3D-printed polycaprolactone within the scaffold system was demonstrated to enhance the mechanical strength and stimulate the in vitro angiogenic and osteogenic performance by releasing copper and silicon ions. Moreover, in a diabetic rat femoral defect model, the biocomposite scaffold showed better angiogenesis and bone regeneration by following diabetic microenvironment remodeling. Therefore, the designed self-adaptive biocomposite scaffold can promote diabetic bone regeneration by sequentially regulating pathological and regenerative cues. This study offers vital insight into the design of a self-adaptive bioactive scaffold for the treatment of diabetic bone defects.},

Disulfide chemistry is used to introduce a self-healing ability in a covalently cross-linked rubber. Autonomous healing of a cut takes place at moderate temperatures and leads to full recovery of mechanical properties. This result is achieved by introducing disulfide groups in the network that are able to exchange, leading to renewal of cross-links across the damaged surfaces. The healing process can be repeated many times. The combination of their unique self-healing properties and applicability for a large variety of polymers makes this approach ideal for coatings. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Most of these nano-sensors rely on either optical instruments or visual colorimetric detection. This paper reviews the detection mechanisms of nanomaterial-based optical sensors as well as the enhancement mechanisms of their specificity and sensitivity. Properties of various optically active nanomaterials, as well as detailed applications of these nano-sensors, are deliberated as well.

abstract = {Weavable sensing fibers with superior mechanical strength and sensing functionality are crucial for the realization of wearable textile sensors. However, in the fabrication of previously reported wearable sensing fibers, additional processes such as reduction, doping, and coating were essential to satisfy both requirements. The sensing fibers should be continuously synthesized in a scalable process for commercial applications with high reliability and productivity, which was challenging. In this study, we first synthesize mass-producible wearable sensing fibers with good mechanical properties and sensing functionality without additional processes by incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into distinct nanocellulose. Nanocellulose extracted from tunicate (TCNF) is homogeneously composited with single-walled CNTs, and composite fibers (TCNF/CNT) are continuously produced in aligned directions by wet spinning, facilitating liquid-crystal properties. The TCNF/CNT fibers exhibit a superior gas (NO 2)-sensing performance with high selectivity and sensitivity (parts-per-billion detection). In addition, the TCNF/CNT fibers can endure complex and harsh distortions maintaining their intrinsic sensing properties and can be perfectly integrated with conventional fabrics using a direct weaving process. Our meter-scale scalable synthesis of functional composite fibers is expected to provide a mass production platform of versatile wearable sensors.},

abstract = {Changes in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) levels to which a certain species are adapted can result in different plant growth responses. Thus, analytical and systematic studies on the mechanisms that plant species use to survive when subjected to changes in PAR are required. To address the lack of literature on this topic for Ananas comosus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different PAR levels on the growth of this species. A completely randomised experimental design was used consisting of subdivided plots containing a total of 1176 forest plants, including 1040 Sc (Schizolobium parahyba subsp. amazonicum), 96 Cg (Cordia goeldiana Huber), 40 Sw (Swietenia macrophylla King), and 13.000 An (Ananas comosus var. erectifolius) agricultural plant species. Seven treatments were established based on this combination of species. These treatments were installed using a completely randomised block design with split plots. Each plot measured 18 m × 24 m, and each treatment was replicated four times, resulting in a total of 28 plots and an experimental area of 12.096 m2. After establishing the treatments, studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of different radiation levels on An plant growth. In this study, pluviometric precipitation data and mean percentage values (53, 64, 71 and 100%) of PAR ($\mu$mol m-2 s-1) were recorded. Over the period between 2003 and 2006, the number of leaves, the lengths of the leaves, and the number of An sprouts were measured every six months. The highest number of leaves was recorded in the treatments in which the plants were exposed to 64% PAR. The number of leaves in this treatment was similar to that in the 71% PAR treatment. However, the number of leaves decreased in the plants that were subjected to either the highest (100%) or the lowest (53%) level of PAR. The use of different PAR levels for An plants under cultivation conditions showed that the best growth rates of the leaves and shoots were associated with lower levels of PAR (53% and 64%). However, cultivation under full sunlight favoured a higher number of leaves. The fibre, leaf and mucilage production progressively increased until the third year of the experiment.},

The mortars with incorporation of phase change materials (PCM) have the ability to regulate the temperature inside buildings, contributing to the thermal comfort and reduction of the use of heating and cooling equipment, using only the energy supplied by the sun. However, the incorporation of PCMs in mortars modifies its characteristics. The main purpose of this study was the production and characterization of mortars with incorporation of two different PCMs. Specific properties of two PCMs, such as particle size, shape, and enthalpy, were determined, as well as the properties of the fresh and hardened state of the mortars. The proportion of PCM was 0, 10, 20, and 30% of the total mass of the solid particles. In order to minimize some problems associated with shrinkage and consequent cracking of the mortars, the incorporation of polyamide fibers and superplasticizer was tested. It was possible to observe that the incorporation of PCMs in mortars caused differences in properties such as compressive strength, flexural strength, and shrinkage. Even though the incorporation of PCM microcapsules resulted in an increase in the shrinkage, it was possible observe a significant improvement in mechanical properties. This paper presents the influence of the incorporation of two different PCMs in mortars. The figure shows the morphology of one type of PCM microcapsules. It was possible to conclude that the incorporation of PCM in mortars caused differences in properties such as compressive strength, flexural strength, and shrinkage.

Consequently, non-contact type nonconventional machining processes, for instance Laser, electro-discharge (EDM) and electrochemical (ECM) machining have become inevitable for machining of SMAs. Though, non-conventional processes have advantages over traditional machining and confirm better machinability but each of them has certain limitations as well.

abstract = {We report an observation of shape-induced phase transition from wurtzite to zinc blende phase of encapsulated CdSe nanoclusters in mesoporous silica. Presence of both the phases is also observed in the as-grown sample before encapsulation. Role of interfacial energy in the energetic mesopores, as the possible origin of phase transition, is thus ruled out, as the samples are encapsulated subsequent to their synthesis in the soft chemistry route. Electron-phonon coupling in the resonant Raman spectroscopic studies, using different energies for clusters of different phase and shape, thereby confirms the presence of both the wurtzite and the zinc blende phases. Transmission electron microscopic studies are used for the direct evidence of the shape-induced solid-solid phase transition between two crystalline phases, for the first time. Small fluctuation of energies, in the form of shape, during its growth may be the driving force for the observed phenomenon, as the surface energy of both the phases stabilizes to the same value. Thus, finally, specific shapes can be used as one of the ways to differentiate the resulting phases.},

abstract = {AuNPs-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) is gaining popularity in both laboratory research and medical applications. It has proven clear advantages in breast cancer therapy over conventional thermal ablation because of its easily-tuned features of irradiation light with inside hyperthermia ability. Notwithstanding this significant progress, the therapeutic potential of AuNPs-mediated PTT in cancer treatments is still impeded by several challenges, including inherent non-specificity, low photothermal conversion effectiveness, and the limitation of excitation light tissue penetration. Given the rapid progress of AuNPs-mediated PTT, we present a comprehensive overview of significant breakthroughs in the recent advancements of AuNPs for PTT, focusing on breast cancer cells. With the improvement of chemical synthesis technology, AuNPs of various sizes and shapes with desired properties can be synthesized, allowing breast cancer targeting and treatment. In this study, we summarized the different sizes and features of four major types of AuNPs in this review: Au nanospheres, Au nanocages, Au nanoshells, and Au nanorods, and explored their benefits and drawbacks in PTT. We also discussed the diagnostic, bioconjugation, targeting, and cellular uptake of AuNPs, which could improve the performance of AuNP-based PTT. Besides that, potential challenges and future developments of AuNP-mediated PTT for clinical applications are discussed. AuNP-mediated PTT is expected to become a highly promising avenue in cancer treatment in the near future.},

abstract = {The phase change materials (PCMs) are encapsulated into porous materials for collecting and storing heat energy has been widely used to overcome the intermittency of solar energy utilization. However, due to the inherent big pore structure and surface characteristics, metal porous materials are not ideal for PCM leakage-proof and slow photo-thermal response. To address these issues, A micro/nanostructured graphene-polyvinyl alcohol nanosheets/Cu(OH)2 nanowire on a three-dimensional Cu foam (CF) to fill with PCM was designed and prepared. In the composite PCM, the polyvinyl alcohol/reduced graphene oxide (PRG) films coated on Cu(OH)2@Cu foam (CCF) provided a large number of active sites for the adsorption of modified paraffin wax (PWS). The prepared composite PCM has a stable structure and high thermal conductivity properties, meanwhile, the strong PRG films play a key role in enhancing leakage-proof and stability. The results show that the enthalpy value of PRG-CCF/PWS are 160.25 J{\textperiodcentered}g−1 after 200 thermal cycles; which still maintains excellent cycle thermal reliability. In addition, under the simulated solar irradiation intensity is 120 mW{\textperiodcentered}cm−2, the heat storage rate and photo-thermal conversion efficiency of PRG-CCF/PWS are 1.37 J{\textperiodcentered}s−1 and 90.25 %, respectively. It shows excellent photo-thermal response and uniform temperature distribution. This work provides an efficient, sustainable and affordable strategy for manufacturing high-performance composite PCM that can efficiently achieve solar energy utilization and energy management.},

abstract = {Autonomous repair systems in construction materials have become a promising alternative to current unsustainable and labor-intensive maintenance methods. Biomineralization is a popular route that has been applied to enhance the self-healing capacity of concrete. Various axenic microbial cultures were coupled with protective carriers, and their combination appears to be useful for the development of healing agents for realizing self-healing concrete. The advantageous traits of non-axenic cultures, such as economic feasibility, self-protection, and high specific activity have been neglected so far, and thus the number of studies investigating their performance as healing agents is scarce. Here we present the self-healing performance of a mortar containing a healing agent consisting of non-axenic biogranules with a denitrifying core. Mortar specimens with a defined crack width of 400 $\mu$m were used in the experiments and treated with tap water for 28 days. Self-healing was quantified in terms of the crack volume reduction, the thickness of the sealing layer along the crack depth and water permeability under 0.1 bar pressure. Complete visual crack closure was achieved in the bio-based specimens in 28 days, the thickness of the calcite layer was recorded as 10 mm and the healed crack volume was detected as 6%. Upon self-sealing of the specimens, the water permeability decreased by 83%. Overall, non-axenic biogranules with a denitrifying core shows great potential for development of self-healing bioconcrete.},

However, processing nitinol is highly sensitive to compositional and thermal changes, affecting the final phase structure and thus temperature of the martensitic transformation. This paper presents a review of various effects of composition and 3D-printing process parameters on changes in transformation characteristics, as well as possible methods for their prevention and post-process heat treatments. It is reported that only by precise process and temperature control it is possible to create 4D products with the ability to realize the multi-stage shape memory effect.

abstract = {Alkaline fuel cells enable the use of earth-abundant elements to replace Pt but are hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline media. Precious metal–free HOR electrocatalysts need to overcome two major challenges: their low intrinsic activity from too strong a hydrogen-binding energy and poor durability due to rapid passivation from metal oxide formation. Here, we designed a Ni-based electrocatalyst with a 2-nm nitrogen-doped carbon shell (Ni@CNx) that serves as a protection layer and significantly enhances HOR kinetics. A Ni@CNx anode, paired with a Co2Mn spinel cathode, exhibited a record peak power density of over 200 mW/cm2 in a completely precious metal–free alkaline membrane fuel cell. Ni@CNx exhibited superior durability when compared to a Ni nanoparticle catalyst due to the enhanced oxidation resistance provided by the CNx layer. Density functional theory calculations suggest that graphitic carbon layers on the surface of the Ni nanoparticles lower the H binding energy to Ni, bringing it closer to the previously predicted value for optimal HOR activity, and single Ni atoms anchored to pyridinic or pyrrolic N defects of graphene can serve as the HOR active sites. The strategy described here marks a milestone in electrocatalyst design for low-cost hydrogen fuel cells and other energy technologies with completely precious metal–free electrocatalysts.},

For reproducibility, this residue is usually cleaned and discarded. Here we instead investigate the target‐side coated materials and employ them as a binder‐free supercapacitor electrode. The ballistic‐aggregated, target‐side nanofoam is compact and features a larger fraction of sp 2 ‐carbon, higher nitrogen content with higher graphitic‐N and lower oxygen content with fewer COOH groups than that of diffusive‐aggregated conventional nanofoams. They are highly hydrogenated graphite‐like amorphous carbon and superhydrophilic. The resulting symmetric micro‐supercapacitor delivers higher volumetric capacitance of 522 mF/cm 3 at 100 mV/s and 104 % retention after 10000 charge‐discharge cycles over conventional nanofoam (215 mF/cm 3 and 85 % retention) with an areal capacitance of 134 $\mu$F/cm 2 at 120 Hz and ultrafast frequency response. Utilizing the normally discarded target‐side material can therefore enable high performing devices while reducing waste, cost and energy input per usable product, leading towards a greater sustainability of nanomaterials synthesis and deposition techniques. },

abstract = {<p>In this study, aluminum-based wastes are used as energy carriers for on-demand hydrogen production through sustainable, eco-friendly, and cost-effective controlled electrochemical corrosion in aqueous solution. The electrochemical process is very effective because it (i) uses waste metals to produce hydrogen, (ii) corroborates to circular economy, (iii) produces high purity hydrogen, (iv) is based on simple hydrolysis reaction of metals in relevant solutions, (v) electricity is not required and (iv) recovers part of the chemical Gibbs energy of the electrochemical corrosion usually entirely lost in the environment. We systematically studied the generation of hydrogen from industrial waste Dust Scrap Aluminum Alloy (DSAA) belonging to Al 6063 series for the first time. The process is investigated in a novel hand-made batch reactor with a low-cost commercial body suitable to an easy scale-up. Kinetics of DSAA hydrolysis reaction was explored by measuring the variation of aluminium ion concentration at different immersion times through Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and weight loss measurements at different temperatures and NaOH catalyst concentrations. The effect of hydrolysis reaction on the composition and morphology of the metal surfaces in terms of formed oxide layers was studied in detail using Optical Polarizing Microscopy (OPM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques. The criteria used to evaluate the hydrogen reactor performance were hydrogen (i) yield and (ii) production rate. The experimental results showed that a strong increase in NaOH concentration (from 0.75 to 5 M) corresponding to a slow increase in hydrolysis reaction temperature (from 38.8 to 49.9 °C) lead to an improvement in hydrogen generation rate of one order of magnitude, i.e. from 35.71 to 421.41 ml/(g∙min). Low but constant rate of hydrogen can be generated for longer times at low NaOH concentrations (0.75 M), while fast and variable hydrogen generation rate occurs at higher concentrations (5 M) in short times. In the case study of Al 6063 series waste scrap, the hydrolysis reactor parameters can be regulated to deliver hydrogen generation rates from 35.71 to 421.41 ml/(g min) according to requirements. We expect that the results presented in this work will encourage researchers to study the possible use of other metal-based and multi-material plastic/metal wastes thermodynamically prone to electrochemical corrosion process as possible source of hydrogen.</p>},

By heating the poly(methacrylic ester)s containing alkoxyamine units on the side chain, the cross-linking reaction was achieved as a result of a radical exchange reaction of alkoxyamine moieties. Kinetic studies have revealed that the cross-linking behavior depends remarkably on concentration and reaches equilibrium at a given reaction time, and characteristic reaction behaviors for thermodynamic reactions have been observed. The de-cross-linking reaction was carried out by heating the cross-linked polymer in the presence of an excess amount of alkoxyamine. It was found that the cross-linked points thermally dissociate and that the reaction system is reversible under stoichiometric control. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Many efforts have been detected to investigate thermochromic (TC) glazing for improving building energy saving, while only a few approaches for daylight performance analysis. In this study, the performance of TC glazing is investigated based on multi-objective optimization for minimizing energy demand while maximizing daylight availability. The effects of five parameters including transition temperature, solar transmittance in clear state, solar transmittance modulation ability, luminous transmittance in clear state, and luminous modulation ability on the building energy consumption and useful daylighting illuminance (UDI300–3000) are examined. Linear Programming Technique for Multi-dimensional Analysis of Preference (LINMAP) is used for the decision-making of Pareto frontier. This research aims to explore the ideal thermochromic glazing by considering the daylight and energy performance of a typical office room, taking the weather condition of Xiamen, China as an example. Although it is impossible to achieve both optimal values of energy consumption and UDI300–3000 simultaneously, the proposed multi-objective optimization method could still provide low energy consumption with sufficient daylight. The non-dominated sorting of Pareto optimal solution (POS) demonstrated that the optimum building energy consumption and UDI300–3000 for single glazed windows are 46.64 kWh/m2 and 70.92%, respectively, while the values for double glazed windows are 44.40 kWh/m2 and 71.88%, respectively. The selected hypothetical TC windows can improve the building energy and daylighting performance simultaneously when compared with traditional clear single and double glazed windows. The presented framework provides a multi-objective optimization method to determine the most suitable TC glazing technologies for designers and architects during the design and retrofit procedure.},

abstract = {Thermosetting plastics cannot be reprocessed and recycled due to their permanent and strong covalent cross-linking bonds, and their use could result in serious environmental pollution and resource wastage. An effective strategy to solve the pollution of waste thermosetting plastics is the development of vitrimer materials with integrated mechanical, self-healing, reprocessable, and welding properties and degradability. Herein, two kinds of epoxy vitrimers were prepared using 100% biobased epoxy monomers by introducing dynamic ester bonds through highly efficient esterification and epoxy reactions. The relationship between dynamic ester bonds and the properties of these epoxy vitrimers were systematically explored. Thermal and mechanical properties, chemical degradability, hydrophobicity, dynamic stress relaxation, self-repair ability, shape memory behavior, and weldability were evaluated. The cardanol-based vitrimers had a high glass transition temperature (76.8 °C) and gel content (98.5%) and underwent dynamic transesterification to exhibit programmable self-healing ability, shape memory behavior, and recyclability. The vitrimers were then employed to fabricate carbon fiber composites with high mechanical strength, rapid chemical degradation, and shape memory properties. The products and mechanism of the chemical degradation of the composite were verified by FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. This work provides guidance for large-scale industrial preparation and practical application of high-performance biobased vitrimer materials and their carbon fiber composites.},

abstract = {The high energy consumption of traditional water splitting to produce hydrogen is mainly due to complex oxygen evolution reaction (OER), where low-economic-value O2 gas is generated. Meanwhile, cogeneration of H2 and O2 may result in the formation of an explosive H2/O2 gas mixture due to gas crossover. Considering these factors, a favorable anodic oxidation reaction is employed to replace OER, which not only reduces the voltage for H2 production at the cathode and avoids H2/O2 gas mixture but also generates value-added products at the anode. In recent years, this innovative strategy that combines anodic oxidation for H2 production has received intensive attention in the field of electrocatalysis. In this review, the latest research progress of a coupled hydrogen production system with pollutant degradation/upgrading is systematically introduced. Firstly, wastewater purification via anodic reaction, which produces free radicals instead of OER for pollutant degradation, is systematically presented. Then, the coupled system that allows for pollutant refining into high-value-added products combined with hydrogen production is displayed. Thirdly, the photoelectrical system for pollutant degradation and upgrade are briefly introduced. Finally, this review also discusses the challenges and future perspectives of this coupled system.},

abstract = {Within product development processes, computational models are used with increasing frequency. However, the use of those methods is often restricted to the area of focus, where product design, manufacturing process, and process chain simulations are regarded independently. In the use case of multi-material lightweight structures, the desired products have to meet several requirements regarding structural performance, weight, costs, and environment. Hence, manufacturing-related effects on the product as well as on costs and environment have to be considered in very early phases of the product development process in order to provide a computational concept that supports concurrent engineering. In this contribution, we present an integrated computational concept that includes product engineering and production engineering. In a multi-scale framework, it combines detailed finite element analyses of products and their related production process with process chain and factory simulations. Including surrogate models based on machine learning, a fast evaluation of production impacts and requirements can be realized. The proposed integrated computational product and production engineering concept is demonstrated in a use case study on the manufacturing of a multi-material structure. Within this study, a sheet metal forming process in combination with an injection molding process of short fiber reinforced plastics is investigated. Different sets of process parameters are evaluated virtually in terms of resulting structural properties, cycle times, and environmental impacts.},

This spurs scientists to design functional materials based on learning from nature. Herein, a systematic review of the biomimetic synthesis and hierarchical structure design of calcium carbonate–based minerals is presented. First, biomimetic synthesis strategies, including additive-induced, template-oriented, and gel-mediated routes to direct the construction of the hierarchical structure, are reviewed. The molecular-recognition technique and directional assembly pathway are then summarized to precisely describe the interactions between inorganic minerals and organic matter, and direct the mineral growth. Next, the underlying mineralization mechanisms governing the evolution of the complex morphology and structure are discussed. Nonclassical pathways that control mineral growth, including the theories of the amorphous phase, oriented attachment, mesocrystal formation, and liquid precursor, are concluded. Finally, herein, the applications of calcium carbonate–based minerals are discussed. Unique hierarchical structure endows minerals with special functions, including optical performance, biomedical applications, and environmental and ecological restoration. Overall, in this report, the biomimetic synthesis of calcium carbonate–based minerals is reviewed, covering the fundamental principles, construction of the hierarchical structure, underlying mechanisms of mineral growth, and functional designs.},

Among the various ingredients used, reinforcing fillers are known for having the most significant effect on the static and dynamic properties of rubber compounds. In this work, two strong nanoscale materials, aramid nanofibers (ANFs) and graphene oxides (GOs), are modified using a silane coupling agent and combined to form a novel hybrid filler. The functionalized ANF/GO (fANF/GO) hybrid filler is obtained by adding functionalized GOs (fGOs) into functionalized ANFs (fANFs). The fANF/GO reinforced rubber compounds are then fabricated and tested to investigate the effect of the novel hybrid filler on mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties. The prepared rubber compounds using hybrid fillers exhibit improved mechanical properties and abrasion resistance compared to rubber compounds only reinforced using fANF or fGO alone and reference compounds. Moreover, dynamic mechanical analysis reveals a 21.8% decrease in the rolling resistance of fANF/GO reinforced rubber samples while preserving wet grip performance. Thus, this research demonstrates the potential of the ANFs and GOs-based functionalized hybrid fillers for the application of high-performance tire treads.},

However, the weak mechanical bond between different materials often results in unexpected weakness sections that reside around the multi-material boundary interface. Thus, strengthening the boundary interface is critical to enabling the wide application of MMAM processes in production. Our work approaches this challenge by introducing a new virtual prototyping method to strengthen MMAM parts by facilitating the design and planning process. In our work, a computational part strength prediction model is built, and this model is used to quickly and realistically predict the mechanical strength of a part design within the context of its manufacturing plan. This enables fast iteration of redesigns to create parts that can be directly printed with improved strength. Compared to the commonly used design of experiment-based approaches, this new virtual prototyping method offers a more time and cost-efficient solution that delivers better designs in a shorter design cycle and with no material wastage by eliminating the need for physical test printing.},

Conventional methods for fabrication of hierarchically macro-and meso-porous inorganic materials have combined macroscale sacrificial templates (e.g. foams, polymer beads and silica spheres) for macropores and block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly for mesopores [3]. However, these strategies rely on complicated and time-consuming multistep procedures, including the preparation of macro-templates. Recently , spinodal decomposition (SD) has been explored to provide a new and simple approach to producing hierarchically macro-and mesoporous materials [4]. In this perspective, we highlight the opportunities and challenges, and provide an outlook of SD-derived hierarchically porous materials for energy storage. SD is a phase-separation process in which thermodynamic instability causes separation of homogeneous blends into two or more phases [5]. Unlike conventional phase-separation via nucleation and growth, SD evolves continuously by uphill diffusion within the blends without any nucleation process. The mis-cibility of a multicomponent blend can be changed by infinitesimal fluctuations (e.g. temperature change, chemical reaction and solvent addition or removal) under unstable supersaturated states. The small fluctuations reduce the free energy of the system and lead it into the spinodal region beyond the thermody-namic stability limit (∂ 2 G /∂X 2 < 0); as a result, the system separates into bi-continuous two-phase macro domains (Fig. 1a). This macrophase separation of spinodally decomposed blends has attracted great attention for fabrication of hierarchically porous inorganic materials by combining microphase separation of BCPs [6-8]. In BCP-based blend systems with an organic additive (e.g. homopolymers and oligomeric precursors), the miscibility of blends is determined by the ratio r N (N additive /N BCP) of the degree of polymerization (DP) of the additive to DP of a block of the BCP. When r N 1, additive molecules are soluble with BCP, whereas at r N 1, macrophase separation occurs spontaneously [9]. Recently, Hwang et al. described a new approach to hierarchically macro-and mesoporous inorganic materials by exploiting these phase behaviors [10].

abstract = {There is an increasingly urgent need of lightweight components in aerospace industry, among which aluminum (Al) alloys have been the optimal materials of choice for aircraft structural parts since being used in the Junkers F.13 aircraft in the 1920s. Compared to other metal materials, Al alloys have a lower density, and the use of Al alloys reduces the total weight of the aircraft and improves fuel efficiency and load capacity. Meanwhile, the strength and hardness of Al alloys with alloying and heat treatment can be significantly enhanced for uses in high loads and vibration environments. Furthermore, in the harsh aerospace environment, aircraft may receive various climatic conditions and chemical corrosion. Due to good corrosion and fatigue resistance, Al alloys demonstrate excellent performance under these conditions, ensuring the long–term service life of aircraft. In addition, Al alloys have good recyclability, and they can be recycled to reduce resource consumption and environmental load, in line with the principle of sustainable development. In recent years, although composites have been widely used in aerospace, high–strength Al alloys are still in an indispensable position. Therefore, this article reviews the progress and applications of Al alloys commonly used in aerospace. The common strengthening methods and advanced manufacturing and processing technologies of Al alloy are also discussed, which can provide references for the development of advanced high–performance aviation Al alloys in the future.},

abstract = {Hierarchically reinforced structures are widespread in nature but less common among man-made materials. In this paper, we show that polyurethane-based thermoplastic polymers can be hierarchically reinforced with laponite nanoplatelets and alumina microplatelets to reach strength and elastic modulus that are, respectively, 7- and 29-fold higher than that of the pure polymer matrix (91.7. MPa and 6.97. GPa, respectively). We find that the selective reinforcement of the polyurethane hard domains with laponite nanoplatelets is key to keep the polymer matrix sufficiently ductile for the incorporation of high concentrations of alumina microplatelets. Effective reinforcement of the polymer with microplatelets of different surface chemistries was only possible after annealing the composite at 130°C to promote strong bonding at the oxide/polymer interface. Large-area composite films and bulk parts exhibiting good alignment of alumina microplatelets were obtained through conventional tape-casting. The concept of hierarchical reinforcement demonstrated here can be explored to obtain composite materials covering a wide range of mechanical properties using only a few reinforcing building blocks within the same polymer matrix. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Two types of samples: Type A with carbon nanotube and Type B without carbon nanotube), and with two different stacking sequences (unidirectional - [0]8, cross orthogonal - [0/90]4) were manufactured for the thermoelectric experiments, DC electrical current was injected through the specimens, and the temperature of the specimens was monitored simultaneously in order to deduce the effect of carbon nanotube on the electrical conductivity change of the specimen. During the test, transient and steady temperature fields were measured on the sample surfaces by infrared thermography, and real-time voltage measurements monitor the sample electrical resistance. The results show that the presence of carbon nanotube produces increasing values of longitudinal electric conductivity $\sigma$L of about 10%. At 9 A, the maximum temperature value is around 95° for unidirectional and 145° for cross orthogonal samples. The presence of carbon nanotube tends to decrease the entire range of maximum temperatures, about 7% on average for the unidirectional and about 4% on average for cross orthogonal samples.},

abstract = {As a water purification strategy, electrochemically coupled ceramic membrane separation (ECMS) has attracted growing research interests in various water treatment applications due to its in-situ cleaning of fouling, sustainability, and high removal of refractory pollutants. We first describe the current state of research, conductive ceramic membranes (CCMs) materials, and synthesis methods. Next, we highlight the membrane interfacial reaction mechanisms of CCMs and the impact of critical parameters in water purification applications. Additionally, we analyze membrane fouling types, influencing factors, and blockage models. Finally, based on the limitations of the existing studies, we make recommendations for future research and applications. Summarizing the discussion, we identified Semiconductor material-loaded CCMs (S-CCMs) as the most promising CCMs regarding cost (material cost and preparation cost), efficacy, and technology maturity. The Janus membrane design concept utilizes both sides of the CCM as the cathode and anode, greatly reducing reactor complexity and increasing energy efficiency. Further, electro-oxidation, electro-evolutionary bubbling, and electro-repulsion at the membrane interface are the main in-situ self-cleaning mechanisms. Current density and membrane flux are crucial parameters for ECMS in the water purification process as they affect the efficacy of contaminant removal. We suggest that a combined blockage model based on the principle of energy head loss in describing the membrane blockage process is optimum. Overall, the review provides essential guidance for CCMs to reduce fabrication costs and improve water purification efficiency.},

abstract = {Hierarchically porous carbons were prepared using a facile preparation method in which diatomite was utilized as both template and catalyst. The porous structures of the carbon products and their formation mechanisms were investigated. The macroporosity and microporosity of the diatomite-templated carbons were derived from replication of diatom shell and structure-reconfiguration of the carbon film, respectively. The macroporosity of carbons was strongly dependent on the original morphology of the diatomite template. The macroporous structure composed of carbon plates connected by the pillar- and tube-like macropores resulted from the replication of the central and edge pores of the diatom shells with disk-shaped morphology, respectively. And another macroporous carbon tubes were also replicated from canoe-shaped diatom shells. The acidity of diatomite dramatically affected the porosity of the carbons, more acid sites of diatomite template resulted in higher surface area and pore volume of the carbon products. The diatomite-templated carbons exhibited higher adsorption capacity for methylene blue than the commercial activated carbon (CAC), although the specific surface area was much smaller than that of CAC, due to the hierarchical porosity of diatomite-templated carbons. And the carbons were readily reclaimed and regenerated. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Formation energies and diffusion barriers of point defects at different sites near $\Sigma$=11(113) grain boundary in copper have been calculated by first principle in order to investigate the interactions between grain boundaries and defects. The results show that grain boundaries (GBs) facilitate the diffusion of both vacancy and interstitial defects to GBs, and the interstitials are more active than the vacancies in this kind of diffusions. Furthermore, with low energy barrier, interstitials could be emitted from the grain boundary and annihilate bulk vacancies, indicating that grain boundaries can play a role of the sink for both radiation-induced defects and significantly improve the radiation resistance of the material. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

To explore the application feasibility of thermochromic coating on exterior multi-layer walls, a numerical model was developed for an exterior insulation wall covered with thermochromic coatings, while the influence of the thermochromic coating was analyzed on the thermal performance of exterior walls by a reference of conventional coating. Numerical results showed that different from the conventional coating, the thermochromic coating showed low absorptivity in summer and high absorptivity in winter. Compared to conventional coating, the peak temperature in outer surface could be reduced by 11.2°C-16.7°C in summer and increased by 7.8°C-10.2°C in winter, while the peak heat flows in the outer surface were reduced by 22.4-38.9 W/m2 in summer and increased by 21.3-26.7 W/m2.

However, the poor compressibility and stability of the aerogel is still challenging the development of aerogel based flexible piezoresistive pressure sensors, simultaneously, it is urgent to pave a way to enhance the sensitivity of these sensors. Here, for the first time, we propose a universal strategy to prepare aerogel skeleton-elastomer shell hybrid porous material with enhanced compressibility for high-sensitive and stable flexible pressure sensors. We found that the elastomer shell disperses the strain in the aerogel skeleton and enhances the compressibility of the aerogel, which improve the stability of the sensor (10000 cycles of compression). More importantly, there are elastomer micro-blocks formed in the hybrid material, these micro-blocks redistribute the strain in the material which contributes to the high sensitivity (10.25 kPa−1) of the sensors. Furthermore, the sensors are successful in monitoring both of the large joint bending and subtle skin vibration, as well as remote controlling toy car and artificial hand. This work provides an effective and universal strategy to enhance the sensitivity and stability of the aerogel based flexible pressure sensors and promotes their development towards practical applications.},

abstract = {Nanotechnology has evolved as a preferred choice in current research arena due to the advantages offered by it. The current research in pharmaceutical development is all about exploring and/or adopting different approaches for preparation of nanostructured drug delivery systems. Electrospinning nanotechnology has made its mark as a technology of choice for preparation of nanofibers for different applications. Electrospinning is a novel, robust and efficient fabrication process that is widely accepted and used to assemble nanofibers with distinct features such as length of several kilometers and diameter less than 300 nm. One of the most striking features of nanofibers is that they provide exceptionally high surface area-to-volume ratio and high porosity, making them a robust and attractive candidate for many advanced applications. Many researchers working on development of medicinal and pharmaceutical product design and development have reported their studies indicating successful implementation of electrospinning nanotechnology for preparation of nanofibers with distinct medicinal and pharmaceutical drug delivery applications. Authors of this article aims to provide a comprehensive review of electrospinning method for preparation of nanofibers with respect to theoretical principle, mechanics of electrospinning, critical process parameters, polymers and drug loaded nanofibers incorporated in different drug delivery systems for various pharmaceutical application.  },

abstract = {NiTi-based alloys are one of the most well-known alloys among shape memory alloys having a wide range of applications from biomedical to aerospace areas. Adding a third element to the binary alloys of NiTi changes the thermomechanical properties of the material remarkably. Two unique features of stability and high transformation temperature have turned NiTiHf as a suitable ternary shape memory alloys in various applications. Selective laser melting (SLM) as a layer-based fabrication method addresses the difficulties and limitations of conventional methods. Process parameters of SLM play a prominent role in the properties of the final parts so that by using the different sets of process parameters, different thermomechanical responses can be achieved. In this study, different sets of process parameters (PPs) including laser power, hatch space, and scanning speed were defined to fabricate the NiTiHf samples. Changing the PPs is a powerful tool for tailoring the thermomechanical response of the fabricated parts such as transformation temperature (TTs), density, and mechanical response. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to achieve a prediction tool for finding the effect of the PPs on the TTs and the size deviation of the printed parts.},

abstract = {In the present work, the machinability of nickel–titanium (Nitinol) shape memory alloy has been discussed. Nitinol is known as a difficult-to-machine alloy due to its high hardness, which requires a large amount of cutting force, resulting in high rate of tool wearing. Therefore, researchers have made an effort to ameliorate the machinability of this material to achieve a finer surface quality. The previous studies found that the cutting speed will remarkably influence the surface properties of machined nickel–titanium alloy in turning process. Tool wear and cutting force are at minimum values in a particular range of cutting speeds so that it leads to diminishing machining barriers such as burr formation and chip-breaking. Lower cutting force and consequently lower temperature and stresses in the machining process improve the mechanical properties as well as reducing hardness, distortion, and residual stress. The machining process was optimized by applying a numerical approach through ANSYS/LS-DYNA R15 software. The obtained results demonstrated the optimum cutting speed in the machining process, which are in good agreement with experiments.},

abstract = {In this study, binderless TiC70N30 ceramic composites with varying graphite (TiC70N30–Gr) reinforcements were fabricated via spark plasma sintering and their effect on densification was assessed. Subsequently, the electrochemical behaviour of TiC70N30–Gr composites was evaluated in 0.5 mol/L hydrochloric acid (HCl), 0.5 mol/L sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and 0.5 mol/L nitric acid (HNO3) solutions using open circuit potential, potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The corrosion behaviour of TiC70N30-based ceramic composites with and without graphite reinforcement exhibited high corrosion resistance in the acidic electrolytes. Composites with 0.5 and 1.0 wt% graphite content showed lower Icorr values of 0.452 µA and 0.081 µA in 0.5 mol/L HCL and 0.5 mol/L HNO3, respectively, while specimen without graphite addition showed better corrosion resistance in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 (0.041 µA). Based on the corrosion results, the corrosion properties of TiC70N30 ceramic composites in HCl and HNO3 solutions were significantly enhanced upon the incorporation of graphite reinforcements. However, the corrosion test results conducted in H2SO4 solution showed that the addition of graphite had a negligible influence on the corrosion resistance of the titanium carbonitride (TiCN) composites.},

In this paper, computational studies of the strength and damage resistance of hybrid and hierarchical composites are reviewed. The reserves of the composite improvement are explored by using computational micromechanical models. It is shown that while glass/carbon fibers hybrid composites clearly demonstrate higher stiffness and lower weight with increasing the carbon content, they can have lower strength as compared with usual glass fiber polymer composites. Secondary nanoreinforcement can drastically increase the fatigue lifetime of composites. Especially, composites with the nanoplatelets localized in the fiber/matrix interface layer (fiber sizing) ensure much higher fatigue lifetime than those with the nanoplatelets in the matrix. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that conventional meshes comprising pure titanium and its alloys can be used to assist the recovery of bone fractures in various parts of the human body, such as the face, jaw, skull and knee. In anticipation of an improved efficiency for these applications and other applications, this work analyses the thermomechanical behaviour of a type of metallic mesh that is fabricated with NiTi shape memory alloys (SMAs), which are smart metals that exhibit functional properties, such as the shape memory effect (SME) and superelasticity (SE). The development of NiTi SMA meshes with different cell designs, good mechanical strength and recoverable deformation to replace titanium meshes and enhance biomedical applications (as well as applications in other fields) can be considered a current technological challenge. In this framework, this study aims to perform the fabrication and mechanical characterization of NiTi SMA meshes produced by investment casting with three different cell geometries (circular, hexagonal and square) in two states (as cast and heat treated). The obtained results show that the manufactured meshes present functional properties even in the as-cast state, as thermoelastic phase transformation and deformation recovery on the order of 6% is demonstrated. The results show that between the heat treatment and mesh cell geometry, the latter factor is the most influential factor in the mechanical behaviour of the meshes. A brief numerical simulation of the tensile behaviour of the meshes is used to deepen the analysis of the influence of cell geometry on their mechanical behaviour. Overall, as-cast meshes with circular and square cells present a high stiffness under tension and bending. The produced meshes show enough thermomechanical features to enhance biomedical applications. These results support the replacement of conventional titanium alloys, which do not possess functional properties, with NiTi SMAs.},

SnO <sub>2</sub> is one such well-researched and proven photocatalyst that is now in use, although it only works with ultraviolet light, which only makes up 4% of the total solar energy received. The present research aims to use iron as a dopant to make SnO <sub>2</sub> active under visible light, enhancing reactions like water splitting and dye degradation. The sol-gel method was used to synthesize the photocatalysts. XRD, BET, UV diffuse reflectance spectra, PL spectra, XPS, and SEM micrographs were used to characterize the synthesized photocatalysts. For 7.5 wt% Fe-doped SnO <sub>2</sub> , a remarkable hydrogen generation rate of 18.81 µmol/hr under sunlight was achieved, nearly three times that of pure SnO <sub>2</sub> (5.71 µmol/h). The nanocomposites display excellent photoreactivity towards RhB dye degradation with an optimal concentration of 7.5 wt% Fe-doped SnO <sub>2</sub> . This optimal composite photocatalyst removes 93% of RhB dye on 0.1 g/L photocatalysts in only 60 min under sunlight. Pristine SnO <sub>2</sub> removes 36% of the dye under similar reaction conditions. The photoluminescence spectra of Fe-doped SnO <sub>2</sub> had lower peak locations than the pristine SnO <sub>2,</sub> indicating a decreased rate of charge recombination and increased life duration of the active species. As a result, hydrogen generation rates and dye degradation efficiencies have increased significantly. The photocatalyst's recyclability study revealed that the photocatalysts can be used efficiently for four cycles without significant reduction in the yield. </p>},

abstract = {The aim of the study was the combination of two measurement methods, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and infrared thermography to evaluate thermal performance of woven and knitted fabrics coated with acrylic pastes containing 20% (P/20) and 40% (P/40) of microcapsules of phase change materials (MPCM) with transition temperatures of 28 °C (MPCM28) and 43 °C (MPCM43). The DSC analysis showed that the phase transition processes for materials modified with pastes P/20 occur in a narrower temperature range than those modified with P/40 pastes. The initial temperatures TOnset(S-S) and TOnset(S-L) are higher for materials modified respectively with pastes P/20 and P/40. The melting and crystallization enthalpy values of both P/20 coated materials are lower by about 45% and 35% compared to P/40. Infrared thermography analysis showed that materials modified with P/20 are heating up faster than modified with P/40 for both MPCM. In the cooling process for modified fabrics the highest temperature decrease was observed in the first 30s. Materials modified with paste P/40 were cooled more slowly in comparison with paste P/20, both for MPCM28 and MPCM43.},

abstract = {In this work, the effects of process parameters on the fabrication of NiTiHf alloys using selective laser melting are studied. Specimens were printed using bidirectional scanning pattern and with various sets of process parameters of laser power (100–250 W), hatch spacing (60–140 µm), and scanning speed (200–1000 mm/s). Cracking and delamination formation, dimensional accuracy, density, and transformation temperatures were examined. Despite the brittle nature of the alloy, fully dense parts have been produced. Laser scanning speed and volumetric energy density were found to be the most influential process parameters on fabricating defect-free samples. It was shown that transformation temperatures are highly dependent on the process parameters. By proper choice of parameters, it is possible to tailor the austenite finish temperature from 100 to 400 °C. The most influential factors on transformation behavior were found to be the laser power and energy density. It is worth noting that these two parameters at higher levels resulted in high process temperatures and therefore a larger level of Ni evaporation. Among the four parameters that constitute the energy density, the hatch spacing does not significantly affect the transformation temperatures. These findings serve as the foundation of developing HTSMA devices with desired geometrical and functional properties.},

abstract = {Diseases affecting the anterior segment of the eye are the primary causes of vision impairment and blindness globally. Drug administration through the topical ocular route is widely accepted because of its user/patient friendliness - ease of administration and convenience. However, it remains a significant challenge to efficiently deliver drugs to the eye through this route because of various structural and physiological constraints that restrict the distribution of therapeutic molecules into the ocular tissues. The bioavailability of topically applied ocular medications such as eye drops is typically less than 5%. Developing novel delivery systems to increase the retention time on the ocular surfaces and permeation through the cornea is one of the approaches adopted to boost the bioavailability of topically administered medications. Drug delivery systems based on nanotechnology such as micelles, nanosuspensions, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, liposomes, dendrimers, niosomes, cubosomes and nanowafers have been investigated as effective alternatives to conventional ocular delivery systems in treating diseases of the anterior segment of the eye. This review discussed different nanotechnology-based delivery systems that are currently investigated for treating and managing diseases affecting the anterior ocular tissues. We also looked at the challenges in translating these systems into clinical use and the prospects of nanocarriers as a vehicle for the delivery of phytoactive compounds to the anterior segment of the eye.},

Two laminate layups were studied: cross-ply, [0/90]25 and unidirectional, [0]16. At first, the fatigue limit based on one million cycles was established for a tension-tension fatigue condition. Then, compression cycling was superimposed on this measured fatigue limit. The addition of this compression loading resulted in the development of longitudinal cracks parallel to the loading direction. This increased the amount of damage and ulti mately led to total specimen failure prematurely. The larger the magnitude of the compres sion cycle, the earlier the development of longitudinal crack occurred and, consequently, the earlier failure occurred. This behavior was due to the inherently poor interfacial bond between matrix and fiber of the tested ceramic matrix composite. {\textcopyright} 1994, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

The unique properties of the material, such as the shape-memory effect and pseudoelasticity, have earned the material increasing popularity for new product innovations. Among the various manufacturing processes available for metal alloys, laser micromachining has taken the lead for processing Nitinol-based products. This literature review provides an analysis of the history and applications of Nitinol, an overview of the microstructure of the material, and a review of the current manufacturing methods for laser cutting medical-grade Nitinol. A more in-depth focus is placed on the realm of laser processing and the challenges associated with the manufacturing process. Ultrafast femtosecond pulse processing delivers promising results and quality for manufacturing Nitinol medical devices. However, there exists a need to investigate potential approaches to increase the cutting speed of the process to enhance throughput and stay competitive in a growing market due to the cutting speed being over 4-times slower than long pulse cutting. Many tactics to address the problem are discussed, ranging from laser selection, processing parameters, and nontraditional laser machining approaches.},

The microstructure, phase-transformation temperature, shape memory capability, and pseudoelasticity were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and bending and tensile tests. NiTi powder with a particle size > 45 µm was selected for the subsequent SLM process, because it exhibited a Ni/Ti ratio of $\sim$1 and a lower oxygen content than powders with smaller particle sizes. A thin-walled disk (0.48 mm thick) and cuboid samples (5 mm thick) were prepared for investigating the variation in the homogeneity of the microstructure. The thin-walled SLM-NiTi sample exhibited a marginally inhomogeneous microstructure between layers, and defects existed in the previously formed side. The cuboid SLM-NiTi sample was fabricated without undesirable secondary phases, and it exhibited a 100% shape-recovery rate under 2% bending strain and completely pseudoelastic under 3% strain. Also, the SLM-NiTi exhibited lower phase-transformation temperatures and a broader phase-transformation range than the original NiTi. The phase-transformation range can be reduced by annealing.},

abstract = {Energy storage systems (ESSs) have been demonstrated to be useful assets to utilities and to others that generate, supply, or utilize electricity. Utilities, for example, have historically relied upon spinning reserve, occasionally provided by a neighboring utility, as a quickly available source of electric power to cope with a host of power-line anomalies. For example, a battery energy storage system (BESS), functioning as a rapid reserve resource, is an excellent substitute for spinning reserve in that its stored energy can be available to power utility loads in less time than power from a spinning reserve resource. Battery energy storage systems are also utilized as uninterruptible power supplies to support relatively isolated utility lines as well as dedicated loads. Other applications include storing energy from renewable, intermittent resources such as photovoltaics, wind-driven generators, and small hydro facilities. In these applications, the BESS provides an advantageous disconnect between resource availability and exploitation of the renewable energy. This article discusses the attributes of energy storage, describes a number of existing and past ESSs applications, and presents a brief description of a conceptual power inverter that converts direct current electricity from batteries, for example, to alternating current (ac) electricity. In many instances, the ac electricity is compatible with that distributed by utilities and, perhaps, may be synchronized and distributed with utility power. Nevertheless, conversions to other voltages and frequencies are also options. A number of historical and existing ESSs are described herein. Most of these are BESSs because they are, perhaps, more representative of the multiple ESS options than other choices and there are numerous BESS examples to cite.},

Selective removal of polystyrene nanosphere templates from a lyotropic liquid crystal-templated silica sol-gel matrix, followed by extraction of the liquid crystal template, affords a hierarchical macroporous-mesoporous architecture. Decoupling of the individual template extractions allows independent functionalization of macropore and mesopore networks on the basis of chemical and/or size specificity. Spatial compartmentalization of, and directed molecular transport between, chemical functionalities affords control over the reaction sequence in catalytic cascades; herein illustrated by the Pd/Pt-catalysed oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamic acid.

There is a vast range of porphyrins that have been isolated or designed, but few of them have real clinical applications. Due to the hydrophobic properties of porphyrins, and their tendency to aggregate by stacking of the planar molecules they are difficult to work with in aqueous media. Therefore encapsulating them in nanoparticles (NPs) or attachment to various delivery vehicles have been used to improve delivery characteristics.

The objective is to investigate the interaction between different PCM and TC pigments in regulating surface temperatures. Three different melting temperatures for the PCMs were tested in consideration of two different colours of the TC paint. Twelve samples were produced with 2.5% mass fraction of PCM and TC pigment each. The emissivity of the samples was measured using infrared thermography. The results showed that a high emissivity in high temperatures and a low emissivity in colder temperatures could be achieved.},

abstract = {Membrane filtration is regarded as one of the promising technologies for water treatment. However, insufficient micropollutants removal and membrane fouling still limited the further application. Herein, this study engineered a novel membrane hybrid system integrating typical pharmaceuticals removal and membrane self-cleaning by assembled layered MXene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). By doping a small amount of MXene into h-BN (mass ratio of 1 to 10), the synergetic process of adsorption and photocatalytic degradation were achieved. Based on experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results, the chemisorption-photodegradation performance of the membrane hybrid system assembled with 1/10 MXene@h-BN was significantly enhanced due to the termination group and conductive property of MXene. In addition, trimethoprim (TMP) degradation by the above membrane followed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood model, indicating pollutants removal initiated not only on the membrane surface but also in the bulk solution under simulated solar irradiation. This phenomenon was attributed to the generation of •OH and 1O2 by forming Ohmic contact with altered internal band structure. The durability and practical experiments with secondary effluent from local wastewater treatment were also tested. The exceptional self-cleaning performance of the membrane hybrid system assembled with 1/10 MXene@h-BN was demonstrated by lower membrane fouling and maintaining durability even after five cycles. Furthermore, the performance (both pollutants removal and flux) of the modified membrane for secondary effluent treatment was also considerable, validating its potential for practical application. Owing to the excellent features, the membrane assembled with MXene@h-BN is anticipated to be an ideal candidate for advanced wastewater treatment.},

A notable improvement in performance has been achieved through recent advances in understanding charge storage mechanisms and the development of advanced nanostructured materials. The discovery that ion desolvation occurs in pores smaller than the solvated ions has led to higher capacitance for electrochemical double layer capacitors using carbon electrodes with subnanometre pores, and opened the door to designing high-energy density devices using a variety of electrolytes. Combination of pseudo-capacitive nanomaterials, including oxides, nitrides and polymers, with the latest generation of nanostructured lithium electrodes has brought the energy density of electrochemical capacitors closer to that of batteries. The use of carbon nanotubes has further advanced micro-electrochemical capacitors, enabling flexible and adaptable devices to be made. Mathematical modelling and simulation will be the key to success in designing tomorrow's high-energy and high-power devices.},

In this study, a shape-stabilized phase change material (PCM) with dodecane as PCM and expanded graphite (EG) as skeleton was developed firstly. The optimal content of EG in composite was confirmed as 16 wt% by heat treatment and DSC testing. The DSC testing results show that dodecane/EG shape-stabilized PCM has a phase change temperature of −9.67 °C and latent heat of 151.7 J/g. The microstructure of the dodecane/EG was characterized by SEM, FT-IR and specific surface area analyzer, and the results show that the dodecane was uniformly stuffed in the pore structure of EG under physical action. Thermal conductivity of the dodecane/EG is 15 times higher than that of dodecane. And the thermal conductivity enhancement of the composite PCM was also verified by the thermal performance test. Moreover, a numerical model of passive storage system with the dodecane/EG PCM was established and the simulation results are highly matched with the experimental result. In conclusion, the prepared dodecane/EG with noticeable thermal permeance and form stability and can be further applied in cold LHTES.},

abstract = {Background Decellularized extracellular matrix has been suggested as a scaffold for heart valve tissue engineering or direct implantation. However, cell removal impairs the physical properties of the valve structure and exposes bare collagen fibers that are highly thrombogenic. Matrix/polymer hybrid valves with improved biological and mechanical characteristics may be advantageous. Methods Porcine aortic valves were decellularized enzymatically and impregnated with biodegradable poly(hydroxybutyrate) by a stepwise solvent exchange process. Biocompatibility was tested in vitro using cell proliferation and coagulation assays. Proinflammatory activity was assessed in vivo by implantation of matrix/polymer patches in the rabbit aorta. Biomechanic valve properties and fluid dynamics were tested in a pressure/flow-controlled pulse duplicating system. Matrix/polymer hybrid valves were implanted in pulmonary and aortic position in sheep. Results Biocompatibility assays indicated that human blood vessel cells survive and proliferate on matrix/polymer hybrid tissue. In vitro activation of cellular and plasmatic coagulation cascades was lower than with uncoated control tissue. After implantation in the rabbit aorta, matrix/polymer hybrid patches healed well, with complete endothelialization, mild leukocyte infiltration, and less calcification than control tissue. Matrix/polymer hybrid tissue had superior tensile strength and suture retention strength, and hybrid valves showed good fluid dynamic performance. The two valves in aortic position performed well, with complete endothelialization and limited inflammatory cell invasion after 12 weeks. Of the two valves in pulmonary position, one failed. Conclusions Matrix/polymer hybrid tissue valves have good biological and biomechanic characteristics and may provide superior replacement valves. {\textcopyright} 2004 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract = {Additive manufacturing of Nitinol is a promising field, as it can circumvent the challenges associated with its conventional production processes and unlock unique advantages. However, the accompanying surface features such as powder adhesions, spatters, ballings, or oxide discolorations are undesirable in engineering applications and therefore must be removed. Plasma electrolytic polishing (PeP) might prove to be a suitable finishing process for this purpose, but the effects of post-processing on the mechanical and functional material properties of additively manufactured Nitinol are still largely unresearched. This study seeks to address this issue. The changes on and in the part caused by PeP with processing times between 2 and 20 min are investigated using Nitinol compression springs manufactured by Laser Beam Melting. As a benchmark for the scanning electron microscope images, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements, and the mechanical load test cycles, conventionally fabricated Nitinol springs of identical geometry with a medical grade polished surface are used. After 5 min of PeP, a glossy surface free of powder adhesion is achieved, which is increasingly levelled by further polishing. The shape memory properties of the material are retained without a shift in the transformation temperatures being detectable. The de-creasing spring rate is primarily attributable to a reduction in the effective wire diameter. Conse-quently, PeP has proven to be an applicable and effective post-processing method for additively manufactured Nitinol.},

abstract = {Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) has received increasing attention for the analysis small molecules. Nanomaterials are frequently used as the matrix in LDI, and various inorganic materials have been developed, particularly those based on thermally-driven positive DI mechanisms. However, the unwanted detection of alkali metal ion adducts in the positive ion mode can compromise small molecule identification. Here, we report the synthesis and application of a novel hybrid bismuth oxide-graphene oxide (Bi2O3@GO) semiconductor matrix for the analysis of small molecules by LDI-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) operating in the negative ion mode. The structure of the semiconductor nanomaterial was characterized using conventional methods and its performance for the detection of small molecules (e.g., amino acids, fatty acids, sugars and other small molecules) was compared with traditional DI matrices (e.g., cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 9-aminoacridine and GO). The results showed that the negative ion LDI-TOF MS of small molecules on Bi2O3@GO were free of matrix-related interferences, and possessed good signal intensity and repeatability. Application of Bi2O3@GO to the quantitative determination of glucose in human serum and soft drinks confirmed that the hybrid matrix could also be applied to complex samples. Conclusions drawn from the experimental results, computational chemistry calculations, and previous studies, suggesting that interfacial photogenerated thermal electron transfer and capture are key processes in the LDI mechanism.},

Tuning the electronic structure and engineering the morphology of TiO2 are effective in reducing photocatalytic activity but remain challenging in drastic reduction. Herein, a Mn-TiO2@SiO2 structure with an average size of 24.4 nm is constructed via a combination strategy of Mn doping and core–shell engineering to accelerate the recombination of carriers and build surface barriers. Impressively, compared with pure TiO2, the 2 %Mn-TiO2@SiO2 shows 336, 447, and 237 times lower photocatalytic reaction rate constants (k) for the degradation of three dyes (reactive red 120, methyl orange, and methyl blue), respectively, demonstrating the drastically reduced photocatalytic activity of Mn-TiO2@SiO2 structure. The characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that Mn doping introduces an occupied deep level and an unoccupied shallow level, which facilitates the co-trapping of electrons and holes, accelerating the recombination of carriers, and the SiO2 shell serves as a barrier to mitigate the interfacial charge transfer. Additionally, surface modification using silanes enables monodisperse core–shell structure and improves its compatibility with substrates, providing the UV-shielding Mn-TiO2@SiO2-C12 silane/fluorocarbon hybrid coatings with high transparency and anti-UV aging ability.},

Mass transfer intensification is a powerful approach to enhance the energy efficiency and reaction rate in the energy conversion and storage processes.

Besides, hierarchical pores are also a contributor to improve the reactant diffusion rate in the matrix. Additive manufacturing, combining the design of printing material and post-treatment, provides a promising opportunity to accurately control the channels and adjust the pores in electrodes, catalysts, and adsorbents.

abstract = {As a promising substitute for fossil fuels, hydrogen has emerged as a clean and renewable energy. A key challenge is the efficient production of hydrogen to meet the commercial-scale demand of hydrogen. Water splitting electrolysis is a promising pathway to achieve the efficient hydrogen production in terms of energy conversion and storage in which catalysis or electrocatalysis plays a critical role. The development of active, stable, and low-cost catalysts or electrocatalysts is an essential prerequisite for achieving the desired electrocatalytic hydrogen production from water splitting for practical use, which constitutes the central focus of this review. It will start with an introduction of the water splitting performance evaluation of various electrocatalysts in terms of activity, stability, and efficiency. This will be followed by outlining current knowledge on the two half-cell reactions, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), in terms of reaction mechanisms in alkaline and acidic media. Recent advances in the design and preparation of nanostructured noble-metal and non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts will be discussed. New strategies and insights in exploring the synergistic structure, morphology, composition, and active sites of the nanostructured electrocatalysts for increasing the electrocatalytic activity and stability in HER and OER will be highlighted. Finally, future challenges and perspectives in the design of active and robust electrocatalysts for HER and OER towards efficient production of hydrogen from water splitting electrolysis will also be outlined.},

abstract = {The continuing growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the rise in fuel prices are the primary motivators in the wake of attempts to efficiently utilize diverse renewable energy resources. Direct solar radiation is regarded as amongst most potential energy resources in many regions of world. Solar energy is a renewable energy resource which may be used for a variety of purposes in present society. The successful utilization of solar energy necessitates the employment of a storage media capable of storing excess energy and then supplying this stored energy when needed. However, large-scale usage of this type of energy is merely viable if potential storage technology could be created having reasonable capital and operating costs. The use of phase change materials is one of the potential methods for storing solar energy (PCMs). Superior thermal characteristics of innovative materials, like phase change materials, are basically needed to maximize solar energy usage and to increase the energy and exergy efficiency of the solar absorption system. Because PCMs are isothermal in nature, they provide better density energy storage and the capacity to function across a wide temperature range. This chapter discusses the fundamentals of phase change materials (PCMs), how they function, thermal energy augmentation in PCMs, commercially accessible PCMs, and active and passive solar heating systems. This chapter presents a detailed study of PCMs usage for solar energy employment as well as storage like for solar power production, solar cookers along with water heating systems. The chapter would help researchers in better understanding on solar power production, water heating systems, and solar cookers employing PCMs for marketable growth.},

abstract = {Water scarcity is a pressing global challenge. Filtration with actual polymeric membranes shows good capability for pollutant separation, but broad applications of polymeric membranes are limited. Filtration can be improved using nanocomposite membranes, which are formed by incorporating nanofillers into polymeric membrane matrixes. The most extensively investigated nanofillers are carbon-based nanoparticles and metal/metal oxide nanoparticles. Here, we review the performance of nanocomposite membranes in antifouling and permeability, their physical and chemical properties and we compare nanocomposite membranes with bare membranes. Nanocomposite membranes generally display better antifouling properties due to the antimicrobial properties of nanoparticles and the reduced roughness of membrane. They also demonstrate higher permeability because of the higher porosity and narrower pore size distribution created by nanofillers. The concentration of nanofillers changes membrane performance, and the optimal concentration depends on both the properties of nanoparticles and the membrane composition. Higher concentrations of nanofillers above the optimal value result in poor performance due to nanoparticle aggregation. Despite intensive research in the synthesis of nanocomposite membranes, most previous efforts are limited to laboratory scale, and the long-term membrane stability following nanofiller leakage has not been extensively investigated.},

abstract = {Tribological behavior of aircraft tire directly affects its service life. In order to improve the strength of tire rubber materials, the Eucommia ulmoides gum (EUG) is introduced to blend with natural rubber (NR) for reinforced composite. However, owing to the complexity of the friction mechanism and huge difference in space-time scale, research on the mechanism of EUG reinforcement and composite-road friction is insufficient at the atom level. Therefore, simulations with different ratio EUG/NR compositions have been carried out for the prediction and analysis of the mechanical, adsorptive, and frictional properties. Results indicate that the EUG enhancement firstly gets strengthen and then gets weaken. The most obvious enhanced mechanical performance occurs when the EUG contents are 20 and 30; the 30/70 EUG/NR composite has the best effect on reducing the static interfacial adsorption mainly formed by van der Waals interaction; 30/70 EUG/NR composite has the highest friction coefficient and relatively low friction deformation tendency. The EUG content should not exceed 40 for optimal reinforced composite. Combining a variety of characteristics, the 30/70 ratio with the highest friction coefficient and relatively high strength is predicted to be the most suitable ratio for aircraft tire applications.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, high strength hydrogels have been intensively investigated. However, developing high strength biofunctional hydrogels for eliciting bone regeneration has been rarely reported. In this work, a mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel is synthesized by one-step copolymerization of acrylonitrile, 1-vinylimidazole, and polyethylene glycol diacrylate, followed by in situ precipitation mineralization. It is demonstrated that the CNCN dipole–dipole pairings combined with the interaction of CaP nanocrystals with polymer chains contribute to tremendous increase of tensile/compressive strength, modulus, and fracture energy up to 6.1 MPa, 11.5 MPa, 6.47 MPa, and 7935 J m−2, respectively. The biomineralization is shown to facilitate the attachment and proliferation of C2C12 cells in vitro. This biomineralized hydrogel scaffold is implanted into an 8 mm diameter critical-size of calvarial defect of rats to evaluate the bone regeneration. 12 week postsurgery results reveal that the mineralized hydrogel exhibits the highest bone volume and density within the defect as measured by computed tomography and histology. This mineralized high strength and tough hydrogel offers a broad range of possibilities to be developed as biofunctional scaffold to promote the reconstruction and regeneration of not only bone, but also load-bearing connective tissue.},

Then, the state-of-the-art of phase field simulations on the thermally induced SMAs are systematically reviewed by concerning the martensite transformation, functional properties, and fracture behavior, and those on the magnetically induced SMAs are also reviewed by considering the magnetic-field-induced strain and mechanical-field- and magnetic-field-induced shape memory effect.

To address the challenges of the large floating charge voltage of Ni-Cd batteries and the vulnerability of a battery's SOC to environmental factors such as temperature, this paper proposes an adaptive adjustment mechanism-based particle swarm optimization (APSO) generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model. The proposed model introduces the concept of the particle aggregation degree to quantify the convergence of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Furthermore, the speed weight of the particle swarm is adaptively adjusted using a comprehensive loss function to optimize the parameters of the GRNN model. To validate the proposed method, simulation experiments are conducted under test conditions using Ni-Cd batteries, and the prediction accuracies of various algorithms are compared. The experimental results demonstrate that the APSO-GRNN model significantly reduces the model's prediction error. In addition, under the influence of different temperatures and noises, this method demonstrates strong robustness and high practical application value by accurately predicting the SOC, even with limited data samples.},

However, it remains a challenge to fabricate hierarchical micro/nanoscaled fibrous scaffolds with different functional components that endow the scaffolds with both biochemical and physical features to exert different biological roles during the process of tissue healing. In this study, a biomimetic designed micro/nanoscaled scaffold with integrated hierarchical dual fibrillar components is fabricated in order to repair dura mater and prevent the formation of epidural scars via collagen molecule self-assembly, electrospinning, and biological interface crosslinking strategies. The fabricated biomimetic scaffolds display micro/nanofibers staggered hierarchical architecture with good mechanical properties and biocompatibility, and it has a more profound effect on attachment, proliferation, and differentiation of fibroblasts. Using a rabbit duraplasty model in vivo, the authors find that dural defects repaired with hierarchical micro/nanoscaled scaffold form a continuous neodura tissue similar to native dura mater; furthermore, the number of scar tissues decreases significantly in the laminectomy sites compared with conventional electrospun microfibrous scaffold. Taken together, these data suggest that the hierarchical micro/nanoscaled fibrous scaffolds with dual fibrillar components may act as a “true” dural substitutes for dual repair.},

Two typical martensite-precipitate microstructures have been observed: intra-martensite precipitates (IMP) and inter-precipitate martensites (IPM). In the former, high density small H-phase nanoprecipitates are embedded in individual domains of different variants of the B19' martensite that form a herringbone structure, while in the latter, finer twinning B19' martensites are confined in between larger H-phase nanoprecipitates. In this study we investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of these two distinct microstructures through computer simulations using the phase field method. In particular, we study temperature- and stress-induced MTs in the presence of H-phase nanoprecipitates, concentration variations and stress field in the B2 matrix created by the precipitation reaction, and the corresponding thermal and stress hystereses and superelasticity for different alloy compositions and aging treatments. The simulation results indicate that densely populated nanoprecipitates 7∼20 nm in length and 3∼8 nm in width lack the strength to impede the growth, coalescence and coarsening of martensitic domains, resulting in the formation of IMP. In contrast, plate-like nanoprecipitates with diameters of ∼100 nm and thickness of ∼20 nm effectively hinder the growth, coalescence and coarsening of martensitic domains, giving rise to IPM. The IPM microstructure is accompanied by an almost linear volume fraction vs. temperature curve with less than 1 °C hysteresis during thermal cycling and a slim stress-strain hysteresis as compared to that of the IMP microstructure. Therefore, thoughtful choices in alloy composition and aging treatment enable the attainment of distinctly varied precipitate and martensitic microstructures, each characterized by unique pseudoelastic or superelastic properties.},

abstract = {ConspectusWearable electronics are smart devices that can be directly worn on the human body. Consumer-grade wearable devices (such as smart bracelets, watches, and glasses) are becoming increasingly popular. They provide continuous and reliable data analysis and guidance in our daily health monitoring and exercise activities. Meanwhile, professional medical-grade wearable devices (such as smart blood pressure monitors and heart rate and blood oxygen detectors) have been widely deployed in many medical institutions to assist doctors in diagnosing and treating patients. The expansion of their application scenarios has created a growing interest in wearable electronics, and the surge in demand for the Internet of Things further drives the market's growth. It is projected that the market size of global wearable devices will exceed US$200 billion by 2026. The major limiting factor to the development of wearable electronics is the absence of reliable energy storage systems that can be directly worn without compromising the devices' compactness, ease of use, and flexibility. One-dimensional (1D) fiber supercapacitors (SCs) have emerged as a promising solution due to their excellent mechanical properties, small size, and unique electrochemical characteristics inherited from SCs. As for fiber electrodes, graphene-based fibers (GFs) have attracted tremendous attention due to the desired properties originating from their main building block, i.e., graphene, including a large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and mechanical flexibility. In addition, wearable electronics move toward converging all and more units into one device for achieving multiple functions, creating increasing power demands. Therefore, research efforts are required to continuously enhance the energy storage performance of GFs and GFs-based SCs (GFSCs). This Account introduces our research on developing 1D GFSCs to power practical wearable electronics. We first discuss the assembly of GFs via hydrothermal methods to translate the properties of graphene into GFs and achieve scalable GF production, including mechanistic studies and process parameter optimization. We also discuss the critical roles of wet GFs' drying conditions in determining GFs' porous structures and electrochemical properties. Next, we present several strategies to enhance the electrochemical energy storage performance of GFSCs, including increasing the specific surface area of GFs and introducing pseudocapacitive materials to GFs. Then, we summarize several methods we used to improve the electrical conductivity of GFs, including adding conductive intercalators between adjacent graphene sheets, constructing core-sheath fibers with highly conductive carbon fiber cores, and tailoring GF hydrothermal conditions. Further, we introduce several device design methods for GFSCs to boost their energy storage capacity, including pairing distinctive electrodes in a single device and self-integrating multiple devices in a planar or three-dimensional (3D) manner. Last, the main challenges and future perspectives on the practical application of GFSCs are discussed. We hope this Account will inspire more research on exploring novel energy storage materials, fabrication of fiber electrodes, and novel electrode and device designs to realize a broad adoption of GFSCs in practical applications.},

abstract = {In this work, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were grafted by silica nanoparticles to prepare CNTs-SiO2 hybrids, which were then incorporated into epoxy matrix to construct a superhydrophobic coating by a facile one-step spaying method. The surface morphology, roughness and wettability of CNTs-SiO2/epoxy coatings were tailored by changing the ratios of CNTs to SiO2. The best hydrophobicity was achieved when the ratio of CNTs to SiO2 was 1:3, showing a WCA of 159.3°. The introduction of entwined CNTs-SiO2 hybrids could not only create a micro-nano hierarchical structure to increase the water repellency, but also offer good mechanical durability of the coating surface against repeated peeling and friction damages, as well as excellent chemical stability under various harsh conditions. Benefiting from the superhydrophobicity of the coating surface and the prominent photothermal conversion capability of CNTs, the CNTs-SiO2/epoxy coating could significantly delay the water freezing time, and efficiently melt the ice layer within seconds under laser irradiation.},

Such trade-offs can be overcome by engineering a material that has an ordered arrangement of structural units, including constituent components/phases, grains, and domains. By rationally manipulating the ordering with abundant structural units at multiple length scales, the structural ordering opens up unprecedented opportunities to create transformative functional materials, as amplified properties or disruptive functionalities can be realized. In this perspective article, a brief overview of recent advances in the emerging ordered functional materials across catalytic, thermoelectric, and magnetic materials regarding the fabrication, structure, and property is presented.

abstract = {In this work, the ablation behaviors of Ti3AlC2 ceramics were investigated in a nitrogen plasma flame at various temperatures. The ablation mechanisms were determined by analyzing phase compositions, macroscopic morphology, and microstructure. As the ablation temperature increased from 1500 to 1900°C, the linear ablation rate increased from − 0.725–8.7 µm/s, while the mass ablation rate increased from− 0.095–2.103 mg/s. At the ablation temperatures below 1900 °C, an oxide layer mainly consisting of Al2TiO5 was formed on the ablated surface owing to the decomposition and oxidation of Ti3AlC2, which adequately protected the matrix. When the ablation temperature reached 1900 °C, the oxide layer melted and was blown away by the plasma flow, resulting in the loss of protection and the rapid increase in ablation rates. The results indicate that Ti3AlC2 ceramic exhibits excellent ablation resistance below 1900 °C and is potentially used as thermal protection material.},

abstract = {Thermal protection materials (TPMs) are crucial in advancing aerospace technology. In order to explore the applicability limits and reusability of MoAlB ceramics used as TPMs, the cyclic ablation performance and mechanisms were studied in a nitrogen plasma flame at about 2000 °C. After 1 to 5 ablation cycles (5 min per cycle), MoAlB ceramics retained their structural integrity. The linear and mass ablation rates were measured as 4.73 µm/s and 2.98 mg/s, respectively, after five ablation cycles (total of 25 min). The ablation resistance of MoAlB ceramics was primarily ascribed to the oxidation layer formed through their decomposition and oxidation. As the cycles extended, the plasma flame gradually damaged the oxide layer and led to the erosion and failure of the MoAlB matrix. Nevertheless, MoAlB ceramics exhibit exceptional resistance against cyclic and long-duration ablation, rendering it a highly promising application for TPMs.},

This review details the application of transition metal oxides and chalcogenides (TMOs and TMChs) in pseudo-capacitors and hybrid supercapacitors (PCs and HSCs). TMOs and TMChs with layer and spinel crystal structure are discussed. The layer materials exhibit excellent capacity and rate performance but inferior cycling performance; On the contrary, spinel materials have a more stable structure and perform better cyclic performance. TMOs suffer sluggish electrochemical kinetics and poor conductivity; TMChs can make up the defects of their TMOs counterparts. Next, strategies to improve the electrochemical performance of PCs and HSCs based on TMOs and TMChs are detailed, mainly from two aspects: designing the composition, optimizing the structures/morphologies of materials, and improving the conductivity of materials in materials' aspects; increasing the mass-loading of electrodes, fabricating free-standing electrode and assembling flexible SCs in technical aspects. Furthermore, in/ex situ techniques and theoretical calculation are discussed to explorer the fundamental mechanism of TMOs and TMChs. Lastly, the future research orientations of SCs are also timely concluded. HSCs based on TMOs and TMChs are the hotpot in the future.},
